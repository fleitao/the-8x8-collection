In this repository, I'm collecting some of the scripts, apps and code samples I've built to demonstrate the capabilities of [8x8 CPaaS](https://developer.8x8.com/). There's much more on my hard drive, but these simple examples should help you understand the structure of the SDKs/APIs and build more complex applications.
