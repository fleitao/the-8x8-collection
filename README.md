My collection of basic scripts and app samples built on top of [8x8 CPaaS](https://developer.8x8.com/) \*.

## Content

In this repository, I'm collecting some of the scripts, apps and code samples I've built to demonstrate the capabilities of [8x8 CPaaS](https://developer.8x8.com/). There's much more on my hard drive, but these simple examples should help you understand the structure of the SDKs/APIs and build more complex applications.

* **sms-simple-2-way**: Using the 8x8 SMS API to send and receive text messages
* **whatsapp-airline-simple-2-way**: An airline bot service for customer care over WhatsApp
* **automation-ping-pong**: Using the Automation API for simple SMS auto-reply
* **automation-sms-menu**: Auto-reply SMS service that digests user input answers  
* **jaas-virtual-events**: simulating a virtual events page using Jitsi as a Service
